CMake Warning at /Users/rodrigobertolotti/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/23.1.7779620/build/cmake/android-legacy.toolchain.cmake:416 (message):
  An old version of CMake is being used that cannot automatically detect
  compiler attributes.  Compiler identification is being bypassed.  Some

  CMake's built-in compiler identification.
